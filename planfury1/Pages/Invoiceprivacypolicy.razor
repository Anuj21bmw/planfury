        <h3 class="subsection-title">Android Application Permissions</h3>
        <p>Planfury Task Tracker requires certain permissions to function properly and provide you with essential features. Below is a detailed explanation of each permission we request and why it is necessary:</p>

        <div class="permission-section">
            <h4><strong>Network and Internet Permissions:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to communicate with our servers, sync task data, receive updates from administrators, and enable all online features of the Application.</li>
                <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Enables the Application to check your network connectivity status to ensure smooth synchronization and inform you when offline functionality is being used.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="permission-section">
            <h4><strong>Location Permissions:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION:</strong> Required to capture your precise location when you perform check-in and check-out operations for assigned tasks. This is essential for administrators to verify that tasks are being executed at the correct locations and maintain accountability.</li>
                <li><strong>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION:</strong> Used as an alternative to provide approximate location data for check-in/check-out operations when precise location is not available.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Location data is a core requirement of Planfury Task Tracker as it enables administrators to track field operations, verify task completion at designated sites, and ensure transparency in task execution. Location is only collected during check-in and check-out events, not continuously.</p>
        </div>

     @*    <div class="permission-section">
            <h4><strong>Camera Permission:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Allows you to capture photos or videos directly within the Application when checking out from tasks or reporting issues. This enables you to document task completion, report problems encountered during task execution, or capture evidence as required by administrators. The camera feature enables real-time documentation of task activities, allowing you to immediately capture and upload visual evidence without switching between applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </div> *@

        <div class="permission-section">
            <h4><strong>Storage Permissions:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Allows the Application to save downloaded task-related documents, media files, and attachments to your device's storage. This is necessary when administrators attach important documents, instructions, or reference materials to tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Enables you to select and upload existing photos, videos, or documents from your device when reporting task status or issues to administrators.</li>
                @*  <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES:</strong> (Android 13+) Allows access to images stored on your device for uploading task-related photos.</li>
                <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_VIDEO:</strong> (Android 13+) Allows access to videos stored on your device for uploading task-related videos.</li>
                <li><strong>READ_MEDIA_AUDIO:</strong> (Android 13+) Allows access to audio files stored on your device for uploading task-related audio recordings.</li> *@
            </ul>
            <p>Task execution often requires reviewing documents provided by administrators and uploading evidence of task completion. Storage permissions enable seamless access to task documents and allow you to upload media from your device's gallery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="permission-section">
            <h4><strong>Notification Permissions:</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> (Android 13+) Allows the Application to send you notifications about new task assignments, task updates, urgent messages from administrators, and important deadlines. This ensures you receive time-sensitive information instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:</strong> Ensures that notification services restart automatically when your device reboots, so you don't miss important task updates.</li>
                <li><strong>com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE:</strong> Required for push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to receive real-time task assignments and updates from administrators.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Real-time notifications are essential for the core functionality of Planfury Task Tracker, ensuring you receive task assignments immediately and can respond promptly to time-sensitive requests from administrators.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We only request permissions that are essential for the Application's core functionality. All permissions are used exclusively for the purposes described above and are never used to collect data for third-party advertising or marketing purposes. You can manage or revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, though this may limit certain features of the Application.</p>
